# World_Weather_Analysis

## Summary

Used API calls to gather weather information from randomly generated latitudes and longitudes, specifically adding weather descriptions. Using input
statements this data was filtered based on temperature preferences. These preferences were used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby
hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities were chosen to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions
API, a travel route between the four cities was created, as well as a marker layer map.
